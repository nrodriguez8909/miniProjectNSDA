# miniProjectNSDA
In this repository we are going to save the codes related to the mini project of the subject Network Science for Data Analytics
In this repository there are 2 main files, 
- one of them is the Gephi project "mini-project2.gephi" which contains all the necessary information for the software to be able to open and display the network we are studying. 
- On the other hand, there is a script in R, with which we generate some of the graphs that we present.
